# Cafe catalog
The project is a cafe and food catalog implemented in Java Spring Boot. It provides a platform for users to browse and search for cafes and their respective dishes. The catalog includes information such as cafe names, addresses, menus, and ratings.

Users can view a list of cafes and filter them based on criteria such as location, cuisine type, or price range. Each cafe has a detailed page that displays additional information. The catalog also allows users to search for specific dishes across all cafes. 

The project utilizes Java Spring Boot framework to handle backend operations such as data retrieval from a database and API integration. It also incorporates front-end technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
